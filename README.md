Spring Boot REST API project which allows users to register and post own recipes.
The project uses the following additions: Project Lombok, JPA with Hibernate in order to store information about users and theirs recipes in a database. H2 Data base was used to store data. 
Each user has an ability to create own account by passing unique username (email) and password (at least 8 characters long). After registering user is able to post their own recipes, view them by selecting unique id number which was given during posting recipes. Additionally there is option to delete or change posted recipes. Also users can search among their recipes by specifying recipeâ€™s name or category. If user tries to perform illegal actions (such as deleting or viewing another users recipes) the Forbidden message would be displayed.
